title: "Backup sync agents"
---

As of Home Assistant Core 2025.12, integrations can provide [sync agents](/docs/core/platform/backup#sync-agents) to allow users to back up and restore their data to and from external services.

Sync agents allows integrations to store backups in a remote location, such as a cloud service or a network-attached storage (NAS) device.

More details can be found in the [backup platform documentation](/docs/core/platform/backup#sync-agents).
