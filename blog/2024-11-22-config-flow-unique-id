title: "New checks for config flow unique ID"
---

### Summary of changes
When a config flow creates an entry with a colliding unique ID, the old entry is currently automatically removed and replaced with the new config entry.
This can lead to unexpected behavior, and will now log a warning.

The integration should carefully consider whether this was intentional or accidental:
- if it was accidental, the integration should probably be updated to use `self._abort_if_unique_id_configured`
- it it was intentional, the integration should probably be migrated to use a reconfigure flow and use `self.async_update_reload_and_abort`

More details can be found in the [config flow](/docs/config_entries_config_flow_handler#unique-id-requirements) documentation.
